- prep 3-4 scenes that happen in each session
- prep a DM's map (for keeping track of gameplay)
- write recaps (again for better anticipation whats about to happen next, see 1st advice; or just providing a recap at begin of next session)
- OR ask players for recap!
- make contingency plans (alternative plans?) --> think about multiple happenings without overplanning (hard one tbh..)
- prep a random list (NPC names, random side quest, traits, etc..) for random encounters
- or use flowcharts (for combat&dialogue)
- put ideas from other media into campaings (get inspired!)
- develop also the npcs in respect to campaign happenings!/keep invested in story!
- train your improv skill!

Guideline by "Lazy DM":
1) Review the PCs
2) Make a “Strong Start” to kick the game off with something fun. 
3) Jot down some “Potential Scenes”
4) Jot down some “Secrets & Clues”
5) Important NPCs
6) Fantastic Locations (or a good map)
7) Encounters
8) Treasures & Loot
