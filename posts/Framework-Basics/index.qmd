**Get a brief introduction about the markdown basics used to build this blog!**

A markup file is a text file with embedded commands. These commands can be simple text formatting characters or complete r scripts. A rmd-file is a mixture of R commands , normal text and formatting code. For a cheat sheet on markdown/quarto basics, see [1](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) or [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for additional information. Markdown commands for special formatting such as adding colors, embedding comments, videos or table of contents, can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/#overview).
